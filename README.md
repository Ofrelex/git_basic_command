# git_basic_command
In this mini project, we'll create a step-by-step project to simulate the workflow of Tom and Jerry using Git and GitHub. This hands-on project will include installation of Git, setting up a GitHub repository, cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch.
